Talk together cross teams, and help each other.

If you are stuck with the code, put some time on the articles in DocsSrc\Articles, remeber that itÂ´s possible to run the documentation as a websever a access it using a browser.

## Test

In the respository is there a solution called IntegrationTests. This contains two projects, a unittest project and a console application project.

If you run the IntegrationTest-console application while having your webserver running will it run a collection of tests against your webserver, these tests matches the requirements in the assignment.
